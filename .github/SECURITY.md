# Security Policy

The security of this project is taken seriously. We appreciate your efforts to
responsibly disclose any findings and will make every effort to acknowledge
your contributions.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided only for the latest released version of this
app. Users are strongly encouraged to keep their installations up to date.

| Version        | Supported          |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| Latest release | :white_check_mark: |
| Older releases | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues,
discussions, or pull requests.**

Instead, report them privately through GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting:

[**Report a vulnerability**](https://github.com/hassio-addons/app-phpmyadmin/security/advisories/new)

If for any reason you are unable to use GitHub's private vulnerability
reporting, you may also reach out to the maintainer by email at
[opensource@frenck.dev](mailto:opensource@frenck.dev).

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce, or a proof of concept.
- Affected version(s) of the app.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Timeline

- **Acknowledgement:** you will receive an acknowledgement of your report
  within **48 hours**.
- **Initial assessment:** a triage and initial severity assessment will be
  shared within **7 days** of the acknowledgement.
- **Fix and disclosure:** valid reports are targeted for resolution and
  coordinated public disclosure within **90 days** of the initial report,
  depending on complexity and impact.

You will be kept informed throughout the process and credited in the release
notes for the fix, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Out of Scope

The following are **not** considered security vulnerabilities in this project:

- Vulnerabilities in the base image, Alpine packages, or other upstream
  dependencies. These are handled continuously by
  [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) and addressed through
  regular dependency updates.
- Issues only reproducible on releases older than the latest released version
  of this app.
- Issues in phpMyAdmin itself; please report those directly to the
  [phpMyAdmin project](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/security/policy).
- Exposure of the app to untrusted networks. The app is served through Home
  Assistant ingress and assumes the Home Assistant instance it runs on, and
  the MariaDB app it is pointed at, are trusted.

## Scope

This security policy covers the phpMyAdmin app distributed by the Home
Assistant Community Apps project and its source code in this repository.
